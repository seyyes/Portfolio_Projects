PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project is about analysing a world happiness dataset using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. The analysis is based on different factors like country, Region, hapiness rank, happiness score, GDP, Family support, Health, Freedom, Trust, ... After data exploration,  cleaning and correlation checking, weâ€™ve performed data analysis by answering to the following questions:

What are the Top 10 most/least happy countries ?

How does happiness vary across regions ?

What is the overall distribution of happiness scores among different countries? (Top 20)

Which country is the most/least generous?

Does the level of social support (measured by the "Family" column) affect a country's happiness score? How does it compare to other factors like GDP per capita?

Is there a relationship between freedom and happiness?Are countries with higher levels of freedom more likely to have higher happiness scores?

How does the level of trust in government affect a country's happiness score?
