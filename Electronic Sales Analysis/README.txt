PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by exploring and cleaning data. Then we’ve performed data analysis by exploring 5 high level business questions related to our data:

What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
