The project is about creating an analysis about the world hapiness dataset produced in 2015.

Business Problem/Objective:

Provide insights and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making with world happiness data.

Before building the dashboard, we've performed data cleansing with Power Query and created some measures.

Useful Insights:

Filters based on Country, Region and level of happiness allow users filtering if needed.

The analysis is done using different charts:

Happiness score VS GDP per capita: 
This scatter plot chart shows the correlation between Happiness score and GDP per capita. With a correlation of 0.78, there's a strong relationship between these two variables. The higher the GDP is the higer the score is.

Correlation heatmap:
The correlation heatmap is based on the correlation matrix of different variables of the dataset and shows the relationship between them. 

Map:
Like the heatmap, the world map, based on the country and the level of happiness shows the distribution of hapiness the world.

Histogram: 
The histogram show the ranking of happiness of differents countries and have filtered for the top 10. It comes out that Switzerland is the happiest country in the world with a score of 7,59.

KPI Cards:
Beside charts, there are KPI cards showing the number of countries of the dataset, the max, the min and the average of happiness score and happiest country.
